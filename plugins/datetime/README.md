This plugin provides time and date items. '`date`' provides the current date. '`time`' provides the current local time. '`unix`' provides the current unix timestamp. '`utc`' provides the current UTC time. Digits are interpreted as unix timestamp and converted to local time.

A dedicated timezone trigger handler returns datetimes for timezones.
